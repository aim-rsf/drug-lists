This repository has been setup to share drug lists across NIHR's AIM projects.
Currently, the drug lists come from the AIM Consortium OPTIMAL, based in Birmingham.
You can find all the drug lists created by OPTIMAL in [this repository](https://github.com/aim-rsf/phenotypes/tree/main/Drug%20Codes).

## About the lists
There is variation in how different systems approach the classification and mapping of various drugs, and it has been noted that there is a lack of single data consistency. 

The drug lists have been created using different methods to find a more efficient process to integrate as part of the Code Builder tool:

- **Method 1**: Involved manually curating a list of generic drug names on the BNF, and searching for respective brand names on the dm+d browser
- **Method 2**: Involves the use of both the [`snomedizer`](https://github.com/ramses-antibiotics/snomedizer) `R` package and a dm+d tool implementation (downloading latest dm+d distribution from NHS [Technology Reference Update Distribution TRUD webpage](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/guest/filters/0/home)). It's in the pipeline to create a self-contained wrapper for this process.
  - this method is a substance-based approach and involves running through a list of IDs for medicinal products.
