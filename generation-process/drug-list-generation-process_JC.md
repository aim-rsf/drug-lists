# Drug Code List Generation Process

This document outlines the code list generation process as set up by Dr. Jennifer Cooper (University of Birmingham) for use by Mahwish Mohammad (The Alan Turing Institute).

## Steps

1. Refer to the document on agreed list of conditions to be included in studies of multimorbidity (list-of-conditions_draft).
2. Use the **BNF treatment summaries** for each condition to identify key classes of drugs (and in some cases individual drugs) for inclusion
3. Identify all the generic names of drugs within that class using BNF
4. Use **dm+d** web browser to identify all brand names for each drug 
5. Create a coding checklist with a brief description of the class and record steps 4 and 5 on it
6. Use the DExtER code builder tool to create the code list within all available database dictionaries 
7. Save the using agreed nomenclature or drug codelists
